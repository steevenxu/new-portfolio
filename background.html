                <p>Perhaps some the most difficult times of my life happened in these 2 years. I moved to the United
                    States
                    with little preparations. I left everything behind, all my friends, my school, and my family.
                </p>
                <p>Being a foreign kid at a brand new enviornment, I struggled real hard to catch up. Those 3 years, I
                    spent everyday at the school library reading, studying,
                    and basically, rejecting reality.

                    Highschool started, and I was able to finally open up and catch up on socializing. I joined school
                    sports teams, found my people who had similar goals in mind.
                </p>
                <p>This was also a period of uncertainty, self discovery, and regrets all bundled up in rushed
                    packaging. These four years breezed by quickly. Too many to-be-had conversations, too many
                    would-have-been situations.ü•π</p>

                    I attended University of California, Santa Barbara studying neuropsychology. Being a first-gen
                    college attendee, I struggled yet again to keep up, but was too "egostic" (basically embarrased) to
                    seek help. I started to slip off the grades, and was hit with some serious depression.
                </p>
                <p>This is when I met Linda. She stuck with me and helped me through this tough period of time,
                    encouraged me, made
                    me see who I can be if I just tried. She picked me up and held on until we both graduated in the
                    summer of 2022.

                    During my college times, I started expanding my career interests outside of my major.
                    Interning for <a class="anchor a" href="https://www.inovati.com/">Inovati</a>, <a class="anchor a"
                        href="https://www.icrco.com/">iCRco</a>, and
                    some local startups, I devloped an interest in client-facing tech-focused positions.
                </p>
                <p>In January of 2022, I was hired as a Technical Account Manager for <a class="anchor a"
                        href="https://www.yardi.com/">Yardi Systems</a>. This was a wonderful opportunity granted to me,
                    and I was lucky enough to be recruited into a permanent role before graduation.</p>
                <p> Unfortunately I had to leave this position due to recently moving from Santa Barbara back to the Bay
                    Area, and
                    the constant communiting back and forth was not sustainable.
